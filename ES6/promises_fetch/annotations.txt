There are 3 states of Promises

"Unresolved" -> waiting for something to finish.
"Resolved" -> something finished and it all went ok.
"Rejected" -> something finished and somethig went wrong.

When the status of a promise is "resolved", it returns a callback method called "then".
When something bad happens, "rejected", it returns a "catch" callback method.
