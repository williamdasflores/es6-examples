//var name = 'William';
//var title = 'Software Engineer';
//var hourlyWage = 40;

//ES6
// Do not use 'var'
const name = 'William'; //I expect NOT to change name so that I am using const
let title = 'Software Engineer'; //I expect to change it later
let hourlyWage = 40; //I expected to change it as well

//some time later
title = 'Senior Software Engineer';
hourlyWage = 44;
//name = 'Peter'; -> DO NOT DO THIS

//When you are using const you expected to make a reference throughtout the code not worrying to change
